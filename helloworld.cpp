#include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout << "I like pizza!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "It's really good!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

/* 
std:cout = standard character output
<< is the output operator
character string denoted with "", just like c
you can use the output operator multiple times
std::endl = standard end line
you can do the same thing by using the \n character
but I suspect there are differences
\n has better performance
endline will flush the output buffer (this is important)
*/

// comments and block comments also appear to work the same
